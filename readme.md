# HEOS automation and configuration service

This tiny heos service aims to fill the missing gaps in the heos ecosystem
- Automation
- Profile based configuration

This is currently (August 2024) a work in progress project.
I have no timeline or roadmap (just to be honest).

But i have some pain points with heos i would like to address:
# Why is there no option for profiles that i can select and all the speakers adopt to that profile?
# Why is a speaker that is configured for line in not automatically playing if i switch it on?

Stay tuned :)
